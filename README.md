This is a project I'm doing to try out Vue and, more importantly, [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)! You can view the site on my GitHub Pages: [here](https://morkalork.github.io/socialmoderaterna/#/)!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

npm test
```
